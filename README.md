## 🧠 Why this matters for Quant Research?
Understanding the properties of stochastic signals and how to robustly fit models (without overfitting) is the bedrock of financial engineering. Furthermore, Bayesian methods provide a rigorous framework for decision-making under uncertainty, a critical skill for systematic trading.
